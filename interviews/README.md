## Code related to algorithms problems
------------------------------------------------
Each package corresponds to the underlying data structure or problem.

### Disclaimer
--------------
All the code is my answer to the question and it should not be taken as granted. There may be some better way to implement the solution(s).

### Highlights
--------------
*	LRU
*	Rate Limiter

### Misc
--------
Take a look at the tests to get a better idea on how to use the methods. I tried to comment whenever there were some tricks involved.
